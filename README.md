## Documents

This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ChuckKollar/ClockAnalysis.git) contains code (fragments of trials in some cases) used to understand how
to monitor a pendulum of a clock. The two mechanisms used are that of LIDAR position tracking
and sound analysis (there are also sections of notes to relevant documents) to identify drive
train abnormalities.

At this point there is a working example only of the LIDAR (Slamtec RPLIDAR A2M12)
monitoring found in [monitor_pendulum.py](src/lidar/Robotica/monitor_pendulum.py).
It is currently run on a 2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5. The processing power required
for the quantity of points generated by the LIDAR requires this computational power.
[Here is a movie](LIDAR_and_Pendulum.MOV) that shows the lidar and pendulum in operation.
While there are simpler ways of monitoring the movement of a clock pendulum, the LIDAR
approach was chosen because it allows for the determination of the pendulum swing which
is impacted by defects in the escape mechanism. Data is recorded on a
[ThingSpeak Channel](https://thingspeak.mathworks.com/channels/3258476).
